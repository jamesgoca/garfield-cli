# garfield-cli

Garfield CLI is a command line interface for the Garfield comic.

This CLI uses [Ermel's Garfield Light](https://ermel.org/garfield.php) page to display Garfield comics. This page provides access to the Garfield archive through an easy-to-read interface.

You can read more about this project in my blog post "[Building the Garfield CLI](https://jamesg.app/2020/07/18/building-the-garfield-cli.html)."
